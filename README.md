# combineVectors
This repo manages a project to combine two sorted vectors to return one combined vector in sorted order.

Further properties:
* GitHub actions perform automatic units tests using googleTest as test framework. If all the tests pass successfully, the pipeline is marked as passed and the current working branch can be merged to master.
* Upon tag creation, a new release is created and build artifacts are provided for latest GCC (Linux) and MSVC (Windows). Check here: [Release page](https://github.com/DavidKroeter84/combineVectors/releases)
